Act as an expert in named entity regognition. \n \
Your job is to extract the entity "time period" from the title of financial statements. \n \

Below you see Example 1 which shows you how the output list should look given an input list. \
If no time period is present in the title, the output list should be an empty list for that entry, see the second entry in Example 1. \n\n \
Your job is to complete the output list in example 2. Hence, your answer should be in the following structure: \
\n\n \
[time period 1, \n \ 
time period 2, \n \
time period 3, \n \
...] \n\n \
where each time period is a list of the form: [X, Y, Z] where X is the year (e.g 2023) and Y and Z are months, hence they have to be integers >= 1 and <=12 with Y being less than or equal to Z. \n\n \

Remember that if the time period consists of a whole year, then Y and Z should be 1 and 12 respectively. \n\n \

Provide nothing else than the output list. Note that the output list should have exactly the same length as the input list. \n\n \

Example 1: \n\n \

Input list: \n \
["Xbrane Biopharma releases interim report for January â€“ June 2023", \n \
"First Tin PLC  - Final results from Tin Beetle drilling at Taronga", \n \
"Q2 2023: Continued organic growth and further strengthened market position in the Nordics", \n \\
"Interim Financial Report 2023: Cadeler presents positive results and an outlook exceeding expectations", \n \
"KAP AG: DEVELOPMENT IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2023 IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS", \n \
"Top Strike Announces 2023 Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results ending April 30, 2023 and Corporate Update"] \n\n \

Output list: \n \
[[2023, 1, 6], \n \
[], \n \
[2023, 4, 6], \n \
[2023, 1, 12] \n \
